The files here have been ported over from labVIEW 2011 to LabVIEW 2012. It will only work with a compactRIO or Single-Board RIO with LabVIEW Real Time version 12.0 (Aug 2012) software. This software should be installable from Measurement and Automation Explorer (MAX)

If the FPGA is not compiling, check the bit file signature of the compilation under "Build Specifications" in the Project Explorer, FPGA target. If it is not current, right click and change the bit file name to the one in "FPGA Bitfiles"
