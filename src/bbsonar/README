./colormaps : Contains the colormaps for mapping the grayscale image returned by the bvtsdk to a monochromatic color image.

./lib : Has all the shared object files. Please remember to create a symbolic link in your /usr/lib directory as specified in the note "Setting up the Blueview sdk on Linux" on Evernote. In short, you must do the following:

	ln -s /path/to/lib/libbvtsdk.so.3.5.0 libbvtsdk.so.3
	sudo ldconfig

./include : Contains all the include files (C/C++) of the sonar's sdk

BBsonar.cpp, BBSonar.h, main.cpp : Has the headers and sonar functionality code.

Config.h : All the configuration related defines including the path where the sonar log file, images have to be saved. Please change the home directory path accordingly on your system.

rcript : A small shell script to clean the old build files, compile the code and then run it at one go.


Notes
-----
1. You need to install Opencv on your system, take note of where all its library files and include headers are present. 
On my system the libraries are in /usr/local/lib and the include files are in /usr/local/include, hence I included them in the library and include path respectively. 

2. You must see that at least opencv_core, opencv_highgui and opencv_imgproc libraries are included in your Makefile which will be looked up while linking the bbsonar code containing opencv functions.

3. Out of interest, you can also make use of pkg-config to list out all the dynamically linkable libraries that opencv has on your system by doing:
	pkg-config --libs opencv
