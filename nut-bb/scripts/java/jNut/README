jNut library
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains source files for the jNut library,
which is a Java abstraction bundle to access NUT server(s).
You can use it in Java programs to access NUT's upsd data server in a simple
way, without having to know the NUT protocol.

jNut building requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

jNut requires to be build :
- A Java JDK 6 correctly set in environment (ie bin folder in path)
- A Maven 3 installation set in environment (ie bin folder in path) with
sufficient configuration (internet connection, local repository) to let maven
get all plugins to make processes.

jNut is written in Java SE 1.4 and is tuned to be compiled to Java 1.4 code
level so most of environment can use it.

jNut building
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once JDK and Maven installed and configured, just go into the jNut directory
and type:

	mvn install

The produced package called 'jNut-x.x-xxx.jar' is located in 'target'
subdirectory.

jNut javadoc
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can generate jNut javadoc by typing:

	mvn javadoc:javadoc

Documentation will be generated in 'target/site/apidocs' subdirectory and its
entry point is located at 'target/site/apidocs/index.html'.

Workspace cleaning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The jNut workspace can be cleaned by removing the 'target' subdirectory or by
typing:

	mvn clean

Unit test notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

jNut sources embed some unit tests in the 'src/test/java' subdirectory.
These tests are based on JUnit and are executed between compilation and
packaging phases at each build.

Implementation notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, jNut is not thread safe. It is not protected against concurrent
queries but queries to different clients can be done in parallel as there are
done on different sockets.

Moreover, jNut have no connection preservation system so servers can break down
connections due to timeout.
Application using retrieved data must forget them when a disconnection occurs.
If the application want to maintain the connection, it must implement a
ping-pong mecanism itself.

At present time, jNut do not support SSL connection. It is planned for near
future.

Changelog
