Makefile

- depending on the version of library, please modify "LIB_FOLDER" according to the available library sub-folders under dsaav dir.

OSX

- OSX doesn't allow multiple CommmEth instances to be started, so instead, run the executables with "-sim" as the argument. 
- when in "-sim" mode, "dsaav-sim.cfg" is used as the configuration file. 


Linux

- business as usual...
